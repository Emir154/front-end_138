                    <p class="chapter_text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                        applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use
                        JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of
                        your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about
                        React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>
                    <div class="container_text">
                        <h1 class="header_text">react fundamentals<span class="chapter">Chapter 3</span>
                        </h1>
                        <p class="chapter_text">React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building
                            user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand
                            React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                        <p class="chapter_text">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                        <p class="chapter_text">+ components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                            examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                        <p class="chapter_text">+ JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                            elements inside JavaScript like so: Text> Hello, I am your cat!Text>
                        </p>
                        <p class="chapter_text">The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn
                            even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are
                            declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <Text></Text>
                        </p>
                        <p class="chapter_text">+ props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
                        <p class="chapter_text">+ state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                            how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful
                            for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
                            your components memory!</p>

                        </h1>
                        <p class="chapter_text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has
                            an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an
                            onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                        <p class="chapter_text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their
                            words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same
                            way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
