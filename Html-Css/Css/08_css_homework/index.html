                    for environment setup
                    instructions, they've moved to their own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the

                </h1>
                <p class="chapter_text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                    applications using React and the app platform’s native capabiles. With React Native, you use
                    JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of
                    your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about
                    React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                <h1 class="header_text">react fundamentals<span class="chapter">Chapter 3</span>
                </h1>
                <p class="chapter_text">React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building
                    user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand
                    React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                <p class="chapter_text">We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <p class="chapter_text"><span class="main_span">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to
                    React uses cats in its
                    examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                <p class="chapter_text"><span class="main_span">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax
                    that lets you write
                    elements inside JavaScript like so: Text> Hello, I am your cat!Text>
                </p>
                <p class="chapter_text">The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn
                    even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are
                    declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <Text></Text>
                </p>
                <p class="chapter_text"><span class="main_span">+ props.</span> Props is short for “properties”.</p>
                <p class="chapter_text"><span class="main_span">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as
                    arguments you use to configure
                    how components render, state is like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful
                    for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
                    your components memory!</p>

                <h1 class="header_text">handling text input<span class="chapter">Chapter 4</span>
                </h1>
                <p class="chapter_text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has
                    an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an
                    onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                <p class="chapter_text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their
                    words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same
                    way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "🍕 🍕".</p>
